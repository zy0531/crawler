Anomalies were initially searched for clear rejection or omission from the data to aid statistical analysis, for example to compute the mean or standard deviation. They were also removed to better predictions from models such as linear regression, and more recently their removal aids the performance of machine learning algorithms. However, in many applications anomalies themselves are of interest and are the observations most desirous in the entire data set, which need to be identified and separated from noise or irrelevant outliers.\n"," </p>,\n"," <p>Three broad categories of anomaly detection techniques exist.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-ChandolaSurvey_1-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ChandolaSurvey-1\">[1]</a></sup> <b>Supervised anomaly detection</b> techniques require a data set that has been labeled as \"normal\" and \"abnormal\" and involves training a classifier. However, this approach is rarely used in anomaly detection due to the general unavailability of labelled data and the inherent unbalanced nature of the classes. <b>Semi-supervised anomaly detection</b> techniques assume that some portion of the data is labelled. This may be any combination of the normal or anomalous data, but more often than not the techniques construct a model representing <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/wiki/Normal_behavior\" title=\"Normal behavior\">normal behavior</a> from a given <i>normal</i> training data set, and then test the likelihood of a test instance to be generated by the model. <b>Unsupervised anomaly detection</b> techniques assume the data is unlabelled and are by far the most commonly used due to their wider and relevant application.\n"," </p>,\n"," <p>Many attempts have been made in the statistical and computer science communities to define an anomaly. The most prevalent ones include the following, and can be categorised into three groups: those that are ambiguous, those that are specific to a method with pre-defined thresholds usually chosen empirically, and those that are formally defined:\n"," </p>,\n"," <p>In this big data era, the focus is increasingly on methodologies capable of handling the complexity and scale of data, going beyond traditional approaches to define and detect anomalies in a way that is both effective and efficient for today's data-driven decision-making processes.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-:10_4-0\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:10-4\">[4]</a></sup>\n"," </p>,\n"," <p>The concept of intrusion detection, a critical component of anomaly detection, has evolved significantly over time. Initially, it was a manual process where system administrators would monitor for unusual activities, such as a vacationing user’s account being accessed or unexpected printer activity.

The affordability of digital storage eventually led to audit logs being analyzed online, with specialized programs being developed to sift through the data.
